Custom Navigation & Styling Options
===================================
Striking MultiFlex supports both a default theme menu and the Wordpress Custom Menu option. Styling options for the menus include over 25 color and font size settings, “button” appearance for the top level items, top level navigation arrows (a vertical arrow appearing beside top level items that have childs), subtitles for top level navigation items, custom font technology (Cufon, @fontface etc described in the FONT OPTIONS SECTION above) and Font Awesome icons.

Default Striking Menu Options
-----------------------------
The default menu is based on basic Wordpress page hierarchies and allows for a header menu only, and supports button option and navigation arrows option. However, subtitles and font awesome are not supported in the default menu.

Pages can be arranged in hierarchies by using the **Page Attributes** metabox in edit page/post panel, to set the parent page and to change the order of the children pages.

![Page Attributes][1]

There is no limit to the hierarchies.  The default order by Wordpress is alphabetic.  Use numbers in the **Order** setting to create a custom order if needed.

If using the default menu, all published pages are automatically added to either the top navigation or as a child if a Parent is designated. 

However, one can use the Exclude Pages from the Striking Menu setting in the **General Panel** -> **Navigation Menu Options** tab to pick pages to be excluded.  Choose multiple pages by holding down the Ctrl key on your keyboard while scrolling and selecting in the list of pages.

Wordpress Custom Menu
---------------------

Of course Striking MultiFlex supports the Wordpress Menus system introduced in WP 3.0, with several customizing options available.  Here are some of the pertinent details:

 1. A custom Menu can be set for the Navigation (which is the header navigation) and the footer.
 2. Unlimited menus may be created and used in the Custom Menu widget.
 3. Both top level and children items in the Navigation can be customized for current, non-current and hover colors.  Footer menu items can have a hover color and passive color.
 4. Both top level and child items in Navigation, and Footer navigation can have a Font Awesome Icons.
 5. Top level items can have Sub-Titles, or navigation arrows, but not both.  Font Awesome can be employed with either.  Sub-Titles have their own font size, full color selections (current, hover, passive) and be aligned left, right or center.
 6. Navigation menu items can be multi-line.
 7. Title Attribute is supported.
 8. Open Link in a new window is supported

Activate the Wordpress menu using the setting for such in the General Panel -> Navigation Menu Options.   Toggle the other settings as desired, and visit the Font and Color Panels to style your navigation and aids.  Assign the menus using the Manage Locations tab in the Menus Panel.  An unlimited number of menus may be created.

Custom Menu Widget
------------------

Striking supports the Wordpress Custom Menu widget.  So more custom menu’s may be created, and assigned to different theme sidebars by way of the Custom Menu widget.  This is an excellent resource for enabling menus of related topics to a page or post.

Removing “Home” from the Main Navigation Menu
---------------------------------------------

A frequently asked question is how to remove the Home item from the Navigation menu:

Go to **Appearance** -> **Menu** and select the menu to edit that it is to be removed from in the **Manage Locations** tab.

Find the “Home” item in the **Menu Structure**, click on the inverted arrow in the right side of the button.

![Remove home from navigation][6]

It will open up.  Click on the “Remove” text in the bottom of the dialog.  Then “Save Menu”! 

Menu Subtitles
--------------

Menu subtitles are a special feature of Striking MultiFlex supported in the Wordpress menu option.  Subtitle usage is for top level items in the Navigation menu, and options for this feature are justification of the subtitles (General Panel/Navigation Menu Options tab), color, current color & hover color (Color Panel/Header Elements tab) and font size(Font Panel/Font Size Settings tab).

![Menu subtitle options][7]

Deploying subtitles is very easy:

 1. Go to Appearance->Menus and select your main navigation menu to edit. 
 2. Click on the arrow for a top level menu item in order to access its configuration options.  
 3. In the Description field type in the text desired, and then Save Menu.  
 4. Set the various styling options for justification, colors and font size (you may possibly want to do this first…) and done!

Font Awesome Use In Navigation Menus
------------------------------------

Please see the Font Awesome section for instructions on activating Font Awesome in the theme and other usage opportunities for this font technology.  Font Awesome Icons can be used in both Navigation and Footer menus, including the child items of top level Navigation menu items.  Please note this ability is only available if using the Wordpress menu function.  It is not possible to utilize Font Awesome with the Striking default menu system. 

It is very simple to employ, and the diagrams below illustrates the simple steps to using it:

Once an icon is selected it will show in the navigation item configuration box, and can be easily changed or removed at any time using the settings.

Top Level Navigation Arrows
---------------------------

A very user friendly feature for both theme users and site visitors, which supplies a simple visual cue that top level navigation items in the Navigation menu have childs.  It is easily deployed by the toggling on its setting in the **General Panel** -> **Navigation Menu Options**. 

> Note: this feature cannot be used at the same time as Subtitles and Font Awesome Icons.

The navigation arrow will be the same color as the font text color.

Title Attribute & Linking
-------------------------

The title attribute field is a hover text option supported by Striking MultiFlex.  Its methodology to be deployed is the same as for Sub-Titles, only a different field is used:

 1. Go to Appearance->Menus and select your main navigation menu to edit. 
 2. Click on the arrow for a top level menu item in order to access its configuration options.  
 3. In the Title Attribute field type in the text desired, and then Save Menu.  Done!

The **Open link in a new window tab** is a nice little supported feature that opens any menu item clicked upon in a new tab rather than in the same frame.

**Multi-Line Navigation Titles**
Striking adds support for very simple html tags in Navigation Label field so that one can employ the break tag for creating a multi-line title.  The tag is filtered when the mobile menu switches in…
