Regular and Mobile Logo Options
-------------------------------
Striking offers two separate logo options:

 - Full size logo for desktop viewports
 - Mobile logo uploader for viewports less than 768 px

Both settings are found in the **General Panel** -> **General Header Settings** and are accompanied by 3 other settings for height and spacing options and tagline display.

The **Header Height** setting allows for its adjustment to accommodate various size logos, diff sized navigation text and any content placed into the Header Widget Area.

Multi Option Header Widget Area With WPML & QTranslate Support 
--------------------------------------------------------------
Striking MultiFlex has a unique multi-option header widget area.  This area can be set to:

 - **Support the display of Widgets** using the WP Widgets admin panel (drag any widgets into Header Widget Area sidebar which will show in the Widgets Panel if this option is selected in the setting)
 - **Html mode for advanced** users capable of html styling with a content field
 - **Auto detect and display WPML flags** with custom theme styling for WPML plugin users
 - **Display the Qtranslate Language Switcher widget** in the website with custom styling after being placed in the Header Widget Area sidebar

The widget area is initially a 60px wide x 40px height rectangular area in the top right corner of the header.  Depending on content, one may have to increase the **Header Height** to accommodate the widget area content.  It grows vertically with content.  If one wishes to space multiple widgets horizontally then it should set to HTML mode and shortcoded widgets and html styling employed (div tags, etc).

The widget settings have detailed help fields for the various uses but we include here also some relevant info for the WPML and qtranslate options.

### Displaying Wpml Flags ###
Striking has created an auto display of language flags for the header area based on auto detection of the Site Languages enabled in the plugin.  It is very simple to enable the language flags to show on the header widget area, follow the steps below:

 1. Go to Header Top Area setting
 2. Select Wpml Flags in the Header Widget Area dropdown.
 3. Click the Save Changes button.  All Done!  

### Displaying Qtranslate Languages ###
Like WPML, Striking has custom css styling to support the use of the Qtranslate Language Switcher Widget in the Striking Header Widget Area.  The theme CSS restyles the widget automatically so that the language flags and text (either or both per the widget options) display horizontally across the header area instead of in the usual vertical flag array.

Again the display process is very simple:

 1. Go to Header Top Area setting
 2. Set to Widget area and Save Changes
 3. Go to the Widgets Panel
 4. Drag the Qtranslate Languages Switcher Widget into the Header Widget Area sidebar

All Done! Flags display in a horizontal row from right to left at the top of the header.
