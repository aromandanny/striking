Breadcrumbs
===========
What are breadcrumbs and why use them?  Breadcrumbs or “breadcrumb trail” is a navigation aid used in webpages.  It is visual cue which shows the root path of the webpage for a viewer.  The term comes from the trail of breadcrumbs left by Hansel and Gretel in the popular fairytale.

Breadcrumbs typically appear horizontally across the top of a web page, often below title bars or headers. In Striking MultiFlex they provide a trail for the user to follow back to the top of the hierarchy of which the content being viewed is a part.  Striking uses the » glyph as hierarchy separator in the breadcrumbs trail.

Striking MultiFlex  has built into its core structure the very well-known Breadcrumbs Plus plugin -> so it is **not necessary** to load this plugin or any other for breadcrumbs function in the theme.  Doing so may cause unexpected errors if the scripts conflict with each other. 

Breadcrumbs Control in Striking MultiFlex
-----------------------------------------
Control of breadcrumbs visibility site wide is by way of a setting found in the General Panel/Layout Settings tab. The **Site Breadcrumbs Visibility** determines their display and the default theme setting is  for they to be visible. **ON** enables breadcrumbs throughout the site and **OFF** disables them site wide.

Individual Webpage Override Option
----------------------------------
In any page or post there is a tri-toggle setting (**Page General Options Metabox** / **General Page Setup Tab** / **Breadcrumbs Visibility** setting) to enable or disable breadcrumbs specific to that page.

An example of when this is helpful --> some forum plugins have their own breadcrumbs script which can conflict with the Striking MultiFlex breadcrumbs.  So Striking MultiFlex provides the solution: turn off the theme setting for breadcrumbs and use the **Breadcrumbs Visibility** setting to individually activate breadcrumbs on every non-forum site page.  This way the two separate breadcrumb scripts don’t conflict with each other as they never load together on the same webpage.

But it might also be that one desires to have breadcrumbs only for portfolio items, or blog items and nowhere else.  Whatever your design imperative for breadcrumbs, the combination of breadcrumb settings in Striking MultiFlex can accommodate the desired outcome. 

### USAGE NOTES: ###

 1. Breadcrumbs do not appear on the homepage of a site
 2. the breadcrumb string will depend on how one has set the site permalinks.
 3. The breadcrumb placement in Striking is in the upper left hand corner of the page body section of all other pages and posts.
 4. Typically each navigation layer other than the present page is a clickable link in the breadcrumb string.

Custom Portfolio Breadcrumbs & URL Parent Abilities
---------------------------------------------------
Wordpress does not provide at this time an automatic ability to create a static page for custom post types similar to the ability to designate a static blog page.  However, Striking MultiFlex has custom settings allowing one to emulate the behavior of a static "home" page for portfolios by setting a custom breadcrumbs parent page, and rewrite url for portfolio items.

In the **Portfolio Panel** -> **Custom Portfolio Breadcrumbs & URL Settings** tab are 2 settings for creating a custom portfolio breadcrumbs string and setting a custom permalink slug.

### Portfolio Breadcrumbs Parent Page ###
This setting can provide an alternative as it allows for selection of a page to be the breadcrumbs parent page for all portfolio items that are created for the website.

An example usage with this feature is to have created a "My Portfolio" top level navigation page and then select it in the dropdown field below to act as the parent page for breadcrumbs.  After saving, someone viewing any portfolio post in the site would see in the breadcrumbs string "Home -> My Portfolios -> Portfolio Post".  If no breadcrumb parent is set, then the breadcrumb string appearing in the single portfolio post webpage would be "Home -> Portfolio Post".

#### Per Post Override ####
As it is sometimes necessary to override this theme default setting, the Portfolio Metabox (found below each portfolio item content editor) has a similar breadcrumbs parent setting where a different parent page can be chosen when necessary for specific portfolio items.

### Portfolio ReWrite URL: ###
Similar to the breadcrumbs setting above, this permalink setting allows for creation of a custom url string to be invoked when a site user views a portfolio post webpage.

If no value custom value is set, Striking is coded so that it will use "portfolio" for building the portfolio URL.  So when relying on the Striking default someone viewing any portfolio post in the site would see in the url string "www.yoursite.com/portfolio/portfolioitemslugname".  If a custom value is set below, then the url string would be "www.yoursite.com/customvalue/portfolioitemslugname".

> **HINT**:   
> If you create a Portfolio page in your website, and post your main
> portfolio list(s) in it, then all outward bound links to individual
> portfolio items will reflect the portfolio url string and the custom
> portfolio page will appear to be a static page from the website
> viewer's perspective.

> **NOTE**:   
> Remember to avoid duplicate slug names.  Do not have a page named
> Portfolios, a portfolio category named Portfolios, or a tag called
> Portfolios, etc, as this will cause a malfunction in wordpress and
> elements of your site will cease working correctly.  This duplicate
> slug rule is of course the same for blogs, pages, etc.  The title can
> be the same for each, but the slug should be customized so that it is
> never duplicated.

### Custom Ability for Yoast Breadcrumbs: ###
Another special theme feature is that it has auto recognition and default for Yoast SEO Plugin breadcrumbs --> if the breadcrumbs setting in the Yoast plugin is active Striking MultiFlex autodetects the active Yoast script and automatically deactivates the theme breadcrumbs and displays the Yoast breadcrumbs  in their place.  Thus one does not need to activate this setting at all for the Yoast breadcrumbs, it is managed internally by the theme code.

Striking MultiFlex supports all the Yoast settings such as the custom separator and others found in the Yoast image below.

### Yoast and Woo together in Striking MultiFlex: ###
Part of the custom scripting in Striking MultiFlex is enabling a parse through of the Yoast custom breadcrumbs functions to Woocommerce pages when the latter plugin is active. The image below portrays the default breadcrumb path of a single woocommerce-product.  It will list Home » Posters » Flying Ninja. 

![Woocommerce breadcrumbs default][7]

As woo products are a custom post type it is not showing in the breadcrumbs string. Only the taxonomy is showing (Posters) which they have registered.

However Yoast breadcrumbs have a setting to detect custom post types (Products in Woo) and display them in the breadcrumbs string.  Striking has coded support so that the Yoast setting is automatically parsed through the theme enabling  Home » Products » Posters » Flying Ninja if you have enabled the Yoast settings. Clicking on the 'Products'  breadcrumb will bring you back to the shop listing page. Regretfully there is no way to have that set to "Shop" in the Yoast settings.
