INTRODUCTION & SUPPORT
======================

INTRODUCTION
------------

Thank you for your purchase of Striking MultiFlex & Ecommerce Responsive Wordpress Theme. The developer of Striking MultiFlex has been committed for approaching 4 years to providing Wordpress users an enriched, flexible, multipurpose Wordpress theme that incorporates functions designed to allow a DIY (“Do It Yourselfer”) user to format and display their content in interesting ways without requiring any knowledge of the dreaded Wordpress hooks and filters or html, css, php and js.  At the same time, Striking MultiFlex incorporates the necessary tools allowing advanced users and designers who are comfortable with web code to incorporate custom html, css and js into their design: some examples of this are custom css and custom js fields, advanced functions like inline lightbox capability, and fields in some shortcodes for assigning classes or id for custom css to modify the shortcode output.

Striking is famous as one of the best supported themes anywhere in the Wordpress community, and has had continuous updates (well over 50) since inception in Oct 2010. Striking MultiFlex continues that support philosophy by upgrading the Striking theme to a responsive framework supplemented with many new features and significant ecommerce ability, so as to allow the Striking user base to continue to employ Striking as the preferred website tool for bringing their personal or business presence to the world wide web. If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this document, please feel free to ask question on my [Striking Support Forum][1]. And you should follow me on [Twitter][2] to get the updates.

HELP DOCUMENTATION & SUPPORT
----------------------------

### Doccumentation And In-Theme Help ###

This documentation is intended to **provide general assistance** for the purchaser on installing Striking MultiFlex, a general overview of functionality, special features, and notes on special features and accommodations for certain plugins.  

Striking MultiFlex has very **specific built-in help dialogs within the theme to guide with usage of actual theme settings** and that in-theme help is your guide for specific setting functionality.  We also strongly suggest users take the time to learn about basic Wordpress usage for such matters as permalinks, wp auto resizing, media library functions and more since functionality of these within Striking MultiFlex are mostly determined by Wordpress conventions, not theme code.  Past questions from users indicate that many questions stem from a lack of understanding of Wordpress on Settings, Media and Appearance Menu items in the Wordpress dashboard.  Please visit the [Wordpress Codex][3] for access to their extensive library on Wordpress in order to learn about basic Wordpress functionality.

### ENVATO Support ###

Users who have questions about Envato Support should visit the [Envato Support Center][5].  Please be advised that Envato does not provide any support for any marketplace items and theme support by an author is entirely voluntary.  **Download of a marketplace item fulfills all sale requirements and refunds are not granted after downloading**.  Prior to an item being listed for sale in the Envato marketplace it is tested against a set of standards and if passed is then available for sale in the Themeforest marketplace. The Envato Marketplace standards for themes are rigorous and you are assured that Striking MultiFlex has passed these guidelines in order to be available for sale in the marketplace.  The Authoring Requirements are listed in the Envato Support Center for those who wish to review them.

### Striking Theme Support Policy ###
Support for Striking MultiFlex is divided into two categories:  Product Support and Custom Support. A “free to view and register” support site with an extremely active [Forum][6] is maintained by the Striking Developer for interaction between the theme support staff, and users.  As well, there is a very robust community of users who contribute suggestions and answers for the betterment of all Striking Users.

#### Product Support ####
Historically, Product Support is free and refers to:

 - Keeping the theme bug free and attending to any bugs that are reported by users.
 - Updating the theme from time to time for changes that have occurred to the Wordpress core, to browsers, and to scripts that are incorporated into the theme so that the theme continues to work in good order.
 - Answering general usage questions from users about theme related matters such as where to find a setting or what is the purpose of a setting and its effect.

Questions on implementation of a feature may or may not fall into the product support category, and are determined on a case by case basis at the sole discretion of the support team. Striking MultiFlex has extensive, detailed built in help fields for settings, and work has commenced on videos to illustrate theme functions in order to provide an audio-visual resource for those users who enjoy this form of help option. Video production schedules are not yet determined and are entirely at the sole and unfettered discretion of Striking MultiFlex designer and his support staff availability to undertake such production.

The existing video library is found at the following link:  [Striking Help Videos][7]

Past experience via 10,000+ questions has taught the support team that most issues arise when a user is unfamiliar with basic Wordpress conventions, has not read the settings help fields or documentation, or is attempting to customize via custom css/html/js/php or plugins without a good understanding of web code. The support team will usually attempt to point the way towards the wp codex for understanding, point the way to the correct help fields & documentation and expand upon the matter if relevant. Customization matters are dealt with in the Customer Support section below.

#### Customer Support ####
**Customer Support refers to anything that is not covered by Product Support.**  In general, customer support includes but is not limited to the following: custom html/css implementation, website design, website transfer, SEO, requests that involve php or js modifications, anything to do with custom fields and non-theme custom post types, 3rd party plugin usage, integration or debugging, and child themes and child theme use.  **All such requests are paid support.** Striking MultiFlex maintains a free to post open forum where uses can post such questions in order to seek help from each other, and has an extensive library of post forum questions that can assist with many such queries.

To clarify, the Striking theme is provided **AS IS**, and any situation wherein one wants to modify the appearance, or a function behavior, outside of the theme supplied settings range is customization and support is normally preferred on a paid basis only.  Whether it be changing the theme CSS for one specific instance, or loading a new font into the theme, or modifying the header to accept some custom php or a code object, or difficulty with a plugin, all these and more are work outside of the Striking theme defaults and standing core, and are thus paid support.

The theme support forum has more detailed information on support topics and at any time a user is welcome to query via the forum tools a support team member on a matter and how it is covered in support policy. The support team has an excellent reputation for providing liberal support in the past, and does intend to continue this tradition but there have been frequent and flagrant abuses of the free support model and so it is trusted that the above guidelines assist all users in determining the nature of what is supported and the appropriate terms of that support.

#### Priority Of Themeforest Licensing ####
Nothing in the Striking Theme Support Policy or anything contained herein this Striking MultiFlex Help Documentation is intended to counteract the licensing of the Striking MultiFlex theme by Themeforest and when in doubt the [Themeforest licensing][8] shall apply. The Striking MultiFlex theme developer reserves the right to cancel the theme and support at any time without notice. Per Themeforest licensing, successful downloading of the theme package from the Themeforest website fulfills in full all obligations of Themeforest and the Striking MultiFlex developer in respect of the theme product and nothing contained herein this Striking Theme Support Policy is intended to imply any other obligation, in whole or in part, otherwise.
