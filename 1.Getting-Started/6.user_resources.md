STRIKING MULTIPLEX USER RESOURCES
=================================
INTRODUCTION
------------
To assist all users with their design imperatives, Striking provides 3 resources for configuring the look of a website:

1. 	**Administration Panels** - theme level custom settings  

2. 	**Metaboxes** - page & post level custom settings

3. **Shortcodes** - content level custom settings	

Between these 3 resources are hundreds of optional settings that allow one to manipulate the appearance of the website down to the granular level.  **Every setting has a preconfigured default**, so one can take one's time to learn how each setting will benefit the customization of a site, without being hindered at the outset of the site implementation.

STRIKING MULTIFLEX ADMINISTRATION PANELS
----------------------------------------
Striking MultiFlex has 13 administration panels (also called screens but we will use panel throughout this document and the help fields within the theme software) which contain between them hundreds of settings and functions organized into tab groupings of related items. Access to the panels is twofold -> via an addition to the WP navigation menu below the Settings navigation group under "Striking MultiFlex", and optionally, as another navigation item in the WP Admin toolbar found at the top of any administration panel. The Striking **Advanced Panel** ->**General Tab** has a setting for enabling/disabling the Striking panel links in the admin toolbar.

The settings and functions in the Striking panels are typically used to set a behavior to a characteristic, such as a color, typeface, fontsize, background, or a facet of a content item such as a post featured image position. **Typically, the settings in the Striking Panels can be viewed as the means for exercising control of the website appearance at a macro level**.

As noted in the bottom of the above image, the number of tabs in these panels will increase for plugins such as many ecommerce plugins (Woo, Easy Digital Downloads, WP-Ecommerce, etc)  and Nextgen are in use as they generate their own post or archive types. Striking Responsive will pick these up as long as a plugin follows WP conventions, providing one the ability to create custom sidebars, and create and customize custom post archive and taxonomy feature header title/text content for the plugin generated content.
 

STRIKING METABOXES
------------------

In the edit panel work area when editing a page or a post, one will see new theme related boxes (called metaboxes) added by the theme code, usually placed below the main content editor. An example metabox is the Blog Single Options metabox appearing below the content editor when adding or editing a blog post. Some metaboxes such as the Page General Options metabox appear in almost all work area panels, and others are specific to a type of post being edited.

The purpose of the metaboxes is to provide settings for applying a behavior of a characteristic or function specifically to that page or post. Typically the array of settings will fall into the following purposes:

- 	Some settings will be designed to provide the ability to negate, or oppose a theme setting for the same function/characteristic in a Striking Responsive Panel. For example, the Blog Panel contains a setting for setting the conditions of display of the post featured image in the feature header content area. However, the Blog Single Options metabox has a setting which allows for showing the opposite condition of the theme setting for situations when a single post might need opposite behavior.

- 	There are settings will allow for customizing the appearance of that specific page or post, such as assigning a custom sidebar, selecting the type of feature header to be used on the page, loading a special background for that page/post only, setting different background colors, creating custom css only for that page, and many other page specific controls.

The number of settings in a metabox will vary, ranging for just 1 setting with a selector in the Image Hover Effects Metabox appearing in the Woocommerce Edit Product panel to the 29 settings in 3 tabs appearing in the Page General Options Metabox. **Thus Striking Responsive metaboxes are intended to provide resources for exercising granular control of website appearance at the page/post level**.  

The table below contains a list of the metaboxes and where they are found. Sometimes the metabox will not display on theme activation, or there may not have a need for it. The appearance of metaboxes, both WP default and Striking, is activated & deactivated by checkboxes in the Screen Options Tab in the upper right hand corner of the administration panel. There is also a setting in the Striking Advanced Panel/Metabox Tab for presets for the Page General Options Metabox.

STRIKING SHORTCODES
-------------------
Different themes have different approaches for enabling assistance in content delivery in a page or post. The Wordpress default themes provides only the content editor with a few buttons (an integrated script called "tinymce" provides the buttons and their associated functions) for applying some very basic html to content. The WP core developers advocate that most other functionality should be obtained by plugins, or editing the core files using the supplied code editor, to customize the look. This approach does not work for the average user for a variety of reasons the list of which is far too long to go into here.  
  
Wordpress eventually got the message that this approach was very cumbersome and in WP 2.5 created a shortcode api for plugin developers -> a set of functions within the WP core which developers could hook into and would allow them to create macro codes for use in post content, the goal being to allow an end user to be able to post a short string into the post editor which results in an action or display of some preformatted content. To the "horror" of the WP core team, premium theme developers have come along and used this api along with theme custom code to generate shortcodes for your use without the burden of a plugin (Wordpress does this as well - hence the wp gallery function for example, but just because they did it did not mean anyone else was supposed to....).  

The Striking MultiFlex & Ecommerce Responsive Theme provides the user with a very significant array of shortcodes for generating varied, unique formatted content into a page or post in an easy to utilize manner. **Access to the Striking shortcodes is via a button appearing in the tinymce button group at the top of the content editor** -> in the visual mode look for the last button in the first row, with a stylized capital "S" in the button frame, and in the text editor look for the "Shortcodes" button, again last button in the first row.
 
![Shortcodes Menu][5]

Clicking on the shortcode button will open up a list of sub-items, representing shortcode groups such as layouts, typography, etc., and each group leader has in turn more another level of items, representing the actual shortcodes. Selecting one of the shortcodes will cause a dialogue box to open in the url window, containing settings that have selectors or input fields for customizing the shortcode function. The bottom of the dialogue box allows one to cancel the dialogue, preview the result (in the dialogue box) if so desired, and save the shortcode. Saving the shortcode results in a shortcode string being placed into the content editor, and it will appear similar to the following:  

Example Shortcode String:

> [portfolio column="3" max="10" sortable="true" ajax="true" titleLinkable="true" desc_length="50" advanceDesc="true" more="true" lightboxTitle="image" group="true" effect="hover"]

This example is a portfolio shortcode and its code is a set of instructions indicating the formatting and content to be shown in the page at the place the portfolio shortcode is inserted.  While at the outset these code strings will be unfamiliar we can advise from user feedback over the years that in fact it takes only a short time for the average person to quickly start to understand the intent of the code, so much so that a few users have advised they eventually got used to typing in their most used shortcode strings from memory skipping the shortcode button altogether!!  User feedback has been so overwhelmingly in favour of shortcodes (and panels as well as new settings for the metaboxes) given how they simplify matters for non-coders that the number of shortcodes in Striking MultiFlex has grown by at least 40% since theme inception due to the building in of requests from users.  

So whereas Panels provide pan-website level controls, and metaboxes page/post level control, **Shortcodes are designed to give fine grain formatting control at the content level**. The following table lists the shortcode groups and their attending shortcodes:
