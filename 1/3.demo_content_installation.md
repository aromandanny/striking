DEMO CONTENT INSTALLATION
=========================
As a bonus Striking MultiFlex contains an easy "one touch install" for demo content.  The demo content is also included as a separate xml file found in the demo folder of the Striking MultiFlex Themeforest download. The demo content may assist in learning Striking MultiFlex and contains approximately 100 pages of content plus posts of all types.  It is recommended that the demo content be installed on a localhost installation using wamp or mamp, instead of installing it in a live site, simply as once the content is not needed, it may take some time to delete from the live site due to the amount of content.  Below are the steps to installing the demo content from within Striking MultiFlex:

 1. From the Striking MultiFlex menu select **Striking** -> **Advanced** option which will transfer the view to the Striking MultiFlex Advanced panel.
 2. They very first setting visible is **Install Demo Data**.  Beside the setting title is a little “+” sign which if clicked upon with the mouse opens up a help dialog.  When first using the theme it is suggested the one constantly use these settings help prior to first use.  Click on the “+” sign again to close the help.  They may be opened and closed at will, so as to enable easy help access whenever you need them.
 3. Click on the button below the setting title.  It will bring up a confirmation dialog.
 4. Click on the OK button to proceed with installation
 5. The installation process will commence, and a spinning icon will be visible beside the button while it runs through the installation processes of rendering the included demo content into the website. The installation process will vary, and can take a couple of minutes or more depending on the web host.  Do not be alarmed by timeframes although anything over 5 minutes would be very unusual.  The install process has both success and failure messages although as the content is part of the theme upload package failure is extremely unlikely.  Should failure occur please post a request for help on the [Striking Support Forum][1] and a support representative will reply in due course.
 6. Upon completion a **done** message will appear in green text beside the Install button. Installation of the demo content has been successful.

Widgets will not typically install automatically so it will be necessary to set widgets to widget areas.  

Then go to the website front page. It will now appear like the Striking MultiFlex Themeforest [demo site][3] except there are no widgets. Because Wordpress does not support the export widget settings, if you want to make the site appear the same as the demo site, it will be necessary to go to **Appearance** -> **Widgets** and place some widgets into the widget area (also known as “Sidebars).
