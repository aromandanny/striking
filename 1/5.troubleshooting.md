TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
### After updating the slideshow or post images are not visible? ###
After updating, the first thing to do even before viewing a site is to go to the Striking MultiFlex Advanced Panel, and use the Clear Cache setting to flush the temp “on the fly” cache where the theme stores temp images for quick delivery to webpages.

This will flush the cache and when the page is loaded new images will populate the temp cache for delivery to the webpage.

### After updating the admin panels have lost their formatting and styling? ###
This is a common aftereffect when using webkit browsers such as Chrome and Safari, which store css for pages visited in order to serve them up faster.  If after updating your Striking Admin appears as follows:

This is not a theme related matter but a browser issue, and the solution is extremely easy – clear your browser history and browser cache.  A great program for thoroughly cleaning up browser idiosyncrasies is CCleaner, available for free at http://www.download.com and one of the most popular cleaning & optimizing programs in the world.

### Does your server have the GD library compiled with its version of php? ###
Striking MultiFlex uses the GD library for image resizing.  It requires the server host to have GD library installed as part of its php package. If the thumbnails are not working, check with the webhost to make sure that it is installed as part of the host package. If a cpanel host, it is usually listed in the installed options found in the left column of the home admin panel.

### Does your cache folder have the correct permissions? ###
All files and folders on a website have what is called CHMOD permissions. CHMOD = Change Mode, and refers to the Unix command that determines how much access is permitted to a file or folder.

Sometimes when installing or updating Wordpress, the new Wordpress install may set/reset file permissions resulting in difficulties with images / slider operation / changing colors, etc.  Thus it is a good idea to understand how the web host has set up its server security. Every host sets up their servers differently, and this also can cause some functions not to work correctly until the modified permissions have been set back to their host defaults.

Finally, to change to certain "open" permissions, it will likely be necessary to use the control panel file manager supplied by the host, rather than an ftp program (many ftp programs have a function that allows one to modify permissions). Many hosts configure server security so that open file permissions such as 755, 767, and sometimes even 777 need to be done from a host level.  You may think that you have changed a permission to 755 via ftp (it will often say successfully changed), but if the problem persists, likely the change is not "hardcoded" on the host side. Permissions can be a complex issue, and you should not hesitate to speak with your host customer service if you are running into issues.

> NOTE:  Make sure to give your image cache folder (/wp-content/themes/Striking/cache/) with a writeable permissions.

### Are your plugins compatible with striking multiflex? ###
If experiencing theme issues, remember to check plugin compatibility first.  This should always be a first step in the diagnosis process when having issues within the theme or in display on webpages.  Disable all active plugins in **Plugins** -> **Installed Plugins**, then check to see if this has solved the issue. 

> NOTE that it is very common for many plugins to cease working correctly after a Wordpress core update. 
> Users will many times update both Striking MultiFlex and Wordpress at the same time, discover errors, 
> and then conclude that the errors were due to the theme. But plugins usually lag WP updates by days if
> not weeks, and most often the issue is an out of date plugin.

### Are a wordpress optimizing plugin causing issues? ###
If having troubles with the function like slideshow, lightbox etc... working on the site page, you can go to plugin pages deactivating the javascript optimizing plugin if you used and then check functionality.
