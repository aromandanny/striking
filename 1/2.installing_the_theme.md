INSTALLING ON YOUR WEBSITE HOST
-------------------------------
Before you install theme, make sure your installed Wordpress version is 3.8 or higher. You also need to have PHP 5.2.4 or higher versions (recommended is php 5.3+) and MySQL 5.0 in order for Striking to function correctly. There are two ways to install Striking. Please choose one depending on your situation:

### Installing By FTP ###
Many users are on shared hosting with low upload limits, and in such situations the Striking theme is often too large to install through Wordpress. We suggest you should upload it via FTP.

You will need to first uncompress the **striking_r.zip** file you have found in the master zip downloaded from Themeforest.  This zip uncompresses into a normal folder **striking_r**. This unzipped folder is all you need to transfer via ftp and if you open it, you will see all sorts of folders and css and php files which together contain all the Striking MultiFlex theme coding.

Using the Ftp program transfer this folder which contains the above files to the Wordpress installation theme root directory:  **/wp-content/themes**. Do not upload any of the other files or folders such as **licensing** or **resource** or **documentation**.  Uploading any of the other folders may cause problems resulting in the Striking MultiFlex theme not working properly.

> client or with cPanel: http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes

#### Installing By Wordpress Theme Administration Panel ####
Striking can also be installed by using the Add New Themes option found in *Appearance* -> *Themes* in the dashboard menu.  But first it may be advisable to check to confirm the upload limit of the hosting account is greater than the size of **striking_r.zip**.  If not, please increase it or consult with the webhost on changing the limit.  If needing to increase the server upload limit, the link below maybe be of assistance in guiding how to change:

 - Cufon Fonts: **striking_r/fonts**
 - Fontface Types: **striking_r/fontfaces**

### After Installation ###
After installation, it may be necessary to give the image cache folder **wp-content/themes/striking_r/cache** 755 CHMOD permissions, or the style settings, images and sliders will not working.  Check out the Basic Troubleshooting section below for more info on host file permissions.  In most situations on a modern php server the settings will be automatic but should it be that the slideshows, portfolio items, color selections, etc., are not showing then a likely cause is server permissions – the server security is denying access to the read and write permissions necessary for the theme code to change “on the fly” and display the content.

### Activate Striking Multiflex As Default Theme ###
After completing the upload, activate the theme as per activating any other theme. So go ahead and activate Striking MultiFlex and the installation is complete   Once the theme is activated, there will be a new set of menu options “Striking MultiFlex” in the Wordpress dashboard menu. Expand the Striking MultiFlex menu item if it is minimized and 13 new sub items (the Striking MultiFlex Admin Panels) will show. Now you are ready to start your website development using Striking MultiFlex!!
