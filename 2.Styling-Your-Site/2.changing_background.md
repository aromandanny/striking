Changing Background
===================
Background Options
------------------
The Striking MultiFlex Background panel has 5 resource tabs for controlling a site wide background in each of the major sections of the theme (your webpage): 

 - Box Mode Background
 - Header Background
 - Feature Header Background
 - Page Background
 - Footer Backgrounds

![Backgrounds Panel][1]

Each background type has an array of settings and are considered an intermediate to advanced function, particularly in a responsive environment, where background behavior is dependent upon:

 1. the size of the background image
 2. whether it is a repeating image or not
 3. whether the image is scrolling or fixed
 4. the viewports one wishes to display the background image

and more…

With backgrounds, it is not just a matter of the settings, but of your image and display goals, that determines its success as a background. Striking MultiFlex provides all the settings for placing a background successfully. You will quickly recognize the settings in each resource tab and how they can assist you for your desired outcome.

Adding a Background
-------------------
Adding a background is as follows: 

 1. Click on the Insert Image button and upload a image from your desktop or that has been previously uploaded into the media library.  Background images are uploaded by the Wordpress Media uploader.  After upload make sure the images is the one showing as selected (see image below) and then click on the Select Image button. The image is now attached to that section of the theme.
 2. Select the image X position in the Position X dropdown.
 3. Select the image Y position in the Position Y dropdown.
 4. Select the image repeat method in the Repeat dropdown.
 5. Select the attachment method in the Attachment dropdown.
 6. Select the background size in the Background size dropdown.

Each of the settings will change the behavior of the background image in the website for the chosen section you want the image to show in.  The appearance can be modified by simply adjusting a setting and resaving.  As one adjusts the settings it may also end up that the image itself needs adjustment in which case use the Remove Image button to delete the image, and upload the revised version in its place.

Striking provides is all the settings for placing a background successfully, but backgrounds are an advanced web design skill particularly in the age of responsive web design.  We recommend users who are not so familiar with the “art” of responsive website backgrounds take some time to search for forum posts on the topic as well as visit the [W3Schools Primer on Backgrounds][3] which includes some live learner adjustable demo content, to help familiarize oneself with background essentials. You will quickly recognize the settings in each background type resource tab and how they can assist you for your desired outcome.
 
Custom Background by Page
-------------------------
The background images set using the Background Panel are applied site wide.  This means that a background set for any section will show in every webpage in the site.  However, another unique function in Striking MultiFlex is the ability to set a different page background image per page. You can do so in the **Page General Options** -> **Page Design Settings** tab found below the WP content editor.   

This background uploader has all the settings found for any section background tab in the Background panel, and the image uploaded here will replace any page background set in the Page Background Tab.  It will also replace the **Page Background Color** set in the **Color Panel** -> **Body Elements** Tab.
