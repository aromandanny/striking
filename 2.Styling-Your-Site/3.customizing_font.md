![Font Panel][1]

GENERAL FONT SETTINGS 
---------------------
This is where to set the base Website Font Family and there is a choice of 9 common web safe fonts.  After making a selection a base font is set for the entire site, and any further customization by way of a custom font technology is voluntary.  If satisfied with the base web font it’s not necessary to do anything further - choosing another font(s) for custom or descriptive text replacement is optional and depends on the degree of customization and individuality desired for website appearance.

You can also set the line-height, underline for hovering web-links and **enable the use of Font Awesome Font Icons**.

FONT SIZE SETTINGS 
------------------
This admin tab contains 30 selectors to determine the font-sizes for all the various headers & titles including the body, navigation & sub-navigation, h1 to h6 headers, slider text, blog titles, portfolio titles, widget titles, etc. which are used in the site.

CUFON SETTINGS 
--------------
Cufon is an implementation of javascript, SVG, and Canvas that places your font after the browser has loaded into your website with an amazing amount of efficiency. You can read more about this here in order to get more detailed information about this. 

### USING CUFON ###
MultiFlex has set up a simple yet very flexible method for using Cufon as follows:  

1) 	Go to **Striking** -> **Font** settings.  
2)  Locate Cufon Settings tab and turn on the **Enable Cufon** setting and then “Save Changes”. 
3) 	Click within the **Choose Cufon** font field and select a cufon font from the dropdown list that pops-up.  
4) 	Click “Save Changes” button after which you will see that the chosen Cufon font is added to the **Enable Cufon Replacement for all Descriptive Text Types** setting further down in the tab.
5)	Turn on the font site wide by clicking the On/Off button to the right of the Cufon font of your choice.  
  
Only one Cufon font can be used for descriptive font replacement  unless some custom css code is employed for utilizing a different Cufon font for a specific element in the website.   See the next section on how to use multiple Cufon fonts in a website.

### MULTIPLE CUFON FONTS USING CUSTOM CSS  ###
Striking MultiFlex supports the use more than one Cufon font in a website by way of using custom Cufon css code to implement what is desired.  It is necessary to write out Cufon css code for each element and make clear which font should be applied to it.

First, go to [Cufon][3]  official api page to learn how to write custom Cufon code.  

Use the Firebug extension for Firefox to get the css selector of the text type to be replaced.  

1.  Go to **Striking_r** -> **Font settings** -> **Cufon settings** 

2. 	Choose the font desired from the list in the **Choose Cufon Font** field and then save the panel.  

3. 	Write custom cufon code as below in the  **Cufon Custom CSS Code Field**.  The help field for this setting has some examples as well.

    ```
    Cufon.replace(‘CSS_SELECTOR’, { fontFamily : ‘FONT_NAME’});
    ```  


#### Note: Cufon Delay ####
Sometimes one will experience, depending on the browser, what is commonly known as the Cufon Delay. In this situation a page loads, and as one of the very last steps in the page loading process the process of replacing the web font with Cufon vectors is executed, sometimes with a visible effect and margin of delay. Should this occur and you dislike it, the choice is to select a different Cufon or other font type for use in your site.


### USING YOUR OWN CUFON FONT ###
Striking MultiFlex includes 45 open source popular Cufon fonts. The Cufon fonts that are provided  contain only the Latin-1 character set.   Special characters such as some currency symbols and alphabets such as the Cyrillic alphabet, Russian alphabet etc. will not show correctly.  One can create a custom Cufon font to address special character and alphabet needs. 

The Cufon Tab Help Information contains a detailed walk through of the steps necessary to create and add an additional Cufon Help.
 

### SUPPORT FOR CUSTOM CUFON GENERATION & CSS ###
On a paid basis the Striking development team can undertake custom Cufon font generation as well as creating custom Cufon replacement in a site.  Contact a support team member via the Striking Support Forum for more information on this service.  

@FONT-FACE SETTINGS 
------------------
@font-face is a CSS rule which allows for showing a font on a Web page even if that font is not installed on the user's computer. This means that designers and developers can begin moving away from Web-safe fonts that users have pre-installed on their computer such as Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana and Trebuchet. 

All the latest browsers support the use of @font-face font types now and it should be noted that @fontface provides the fastest font rendering of the font replacement technologies since it is self-hosted.  

### USING FONTFACE ###
MultiFlex has set up a simple yet very flexible method for using Cufon as follows:  

1) 	Go to **Striking** -> **Font** settings.  

2)  Locate @fontface Settings tab and turn on the **Enable @fontface** setting and then “Save Changes”. 

3)	Click within the **Choose @fontface Font** field and select a fontface font from the dropdown list that pops-up. 

4) 	Click “Save Changes” button after which you will see that the chosen fontface font is added to the **Enable @fontface Replacement for all Descriptive Text Types** setting further down in the tab.

5)	Turn on the font site wide by clicking the On/Off button to the right of the fontface font of your choice.

### MULTIPLE @FONTFACE FONTS USING CUSTOM CSS ###

    ```  

### USING YOUR OWN @fontface FONT ###
Striking MultiFlex includes 45 open source popular @fontface fonts. It is certainly possible to add additional @Font-Face fonts to the theme but it is a fairly complex process - the explanation below touches only on the very outline of the necessary steps but covering the process in detail is outside the scope of this theme documentation.  Here is the outline of the steps:

1. 	Go to: [Fontsquirrel][5] and choose a font and create a kit

2.	Download the @font-face kit from Fontsquirrel or generate a kit at Fontsquirrel Generator (preferred)

3.  Using an FTP client to access your host web server, go to **wp-content/themes/striking-r/fontfaces** directory.

4.	Move the unzipped directory to your host server.

5.	Then refresh this tab, and one should see the font now appearing in the list of @font-face fonts available.  

### SUPPORT FOR CUSTOM @FONTFACE GENERATION & CSS ###
On **a paid basis** the Striking development team can undertake custom @font-face generation as well as creating custom replacement in a site.  Contact a support team member via the Striking Support Forum for more information on this service. 

At the Striking Support site there is a link to an additional fontface package for sale for a nominal cost, containing 35 new @font-face fonts.  This kit was developed by an outside party thus it is not part of the theme but it is highly recommended given the time necessary to create it.  

GOOGLE FONTS
------------
Striking MultiFlex supports the use of Google fonts, which is essentially are an alternative easy way of using non-system fonts in a website. Google fonts are a simplified way of using @font-face fonts with all of the font files being resident on the Google servers rather than included in the theme core files. This provides the user access to a very large typeface library without the penalty of storage of the actual typeface files within their webhost.

The downside of Google fonts are that the website generates external scripting actions to the Google server, which adds to the page loading burden (and thus time to complete page load) and as one will find sometimes, cause a page to load very slowly or stall out due to a routing problem or heavy burden on the api at that exact moment (i.e. Google server resources allocated to the font api). Another issue is that in some countries, access to the Google api may be erratic or blocked which will then have a serious impact on the site appearance – something to keep in mind depending on the geographic focus of a website.  

The upside of Google fonts is the library has grown over time and Striking MultiFlex offers 738 Google fonts (the entire library at time of publication of the theme) and Google manages all the licensing of these fonts eliminating this concern for the user.  Go to [Google Fonts][6] to view the entire list.

#### USING GOOGLE FONTS ####

The theme has set up a simple yet very flexible method for using Google as follows:

1)	Go to **Striking** -> **Font** settings.  

2)	Locate Google Settings tab and turn on the **Enable Google** setting and then “Save Changes”.

4)	Click “Save Changes” button after which you will see that the chosen Google font is added to the **Enable Google Replacement for all Descriptive Text Types** setting further down in the tab.

5)	Enable the subsets needed. Subsets support the special characters on the keyboard, the special characters within the languages displayed.  If a subset or language is not shown, then it is not supported by Google at this time.   

6)	Turn on the font site wide by clicking the On/Off button to the right of the Google font of your choice.  

Only one Google font can be used for descriptive font replacement unless some custom css code is employed for utilizing a different Google font for a specific element in the website.   See the next section on how to use multiple Google fonts in a website.
