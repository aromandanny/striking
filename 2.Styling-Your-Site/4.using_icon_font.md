Using Icon Font
===============
The Font Awesome Icon Set is fully integrated into the Striking MultiFlex as a script and accompanying css, but is not active on loading of the theme.  Activation is withheld so that if not using Font Awesome, which has a sizeable css presence (the font awesome css file is almost the same size as the entire theme css) the time penalty for loading of the Font awesome is avoided.

Font Awesome is not actually a font technology for alpha numeric replacement, but an icon set for use in various places in the styling of webpages.  This theme has a very complete integration of Font Awesome as follows:  

-	Font Awesome Icons can be **used in the Top and Footer Navigation menus**, including child navigation 
items if using the Wordpress Menu functionality.  

-	The **Button Shortcode** has a Font Awesome icon selector, including color selection.  

-	The **Tab & Accordion Shortcodes** have font awesome settings including color selection, for the titles.  

-	The **Content Box, Slogan, Icon Box, Process Steps, Milestone,  & Pie Progress** all have icon selectors and in most cases, color selectors as well.  

-	Font Awesome is integrated for use in any page or post content via the **Icon Font Shortcode** located in the Typography shortcode group.  This shortcode has 7 settings including borders, rotate and spin for all icons in the set.  


## ACTIVATION OF FONT AWESOME ##
If Font Awesome icon usage is desired in the website styling, then the icon set first needs to be activated.  The activation setting is found in the **Font Panel -> General Settings Tab -> Activate Font Icons Integration** setting.

The setting has a dropdown indicator and search for  “Font Awesome” in the dropdown field, then Save Changes for the panel, and after such, and font icon selector setting in the theme will work.  

## FONT AWESOME USE IN NAVIGATION MENUS ##
One can use Font Awesome Icons in both Navigation and Footer menus, including the child items of top level Navigation menu items.  Please note this ability is only available if using the Wordpress menu function.  It is not possible to utilize Font Awesome with the Striking default menu system.  It is very simple to employ, and the diagrams below illustrates the simple steps to using it:

Once an icon is selected it will show in the navigation item configuration box, and can be easily changed or removed at any time using the settings.


## FONT AWESOME USE IN THE SHORTCODE ##
The options in the button shortcode are icon selection, and color selection:

In Conclusion, Striking MultiFlex has a very full integration of Font Awesome and it is hoped each Striking based site will find unique and wonderful ways in which to employ this style accessory.
