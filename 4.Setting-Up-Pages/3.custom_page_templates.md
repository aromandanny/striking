CUSTOM PAGE TEMPLATES
=====================


INTRODUCTION TO PAGE TEMPLATE TYPES
-----------------------------------
Striking MultiFlex has 7 custom page templates of which 6 will be available in the **Template** setting of the **Page Attributes** metabox:

 1.	“QuickStart” Homepage Panel
 2. Full Width
 3. Left Sidebar
 4.	Right Sidebar
 5.	Page With Comments
 6.	Sitemap Page
 7.	Landing Page

![Page Attributes][1]

The Homepage Panel is the default site homepage when Striking MultiFlex is first installed.  It is intended to give the beginning user an easy way to generate a front page to their website.


HOMEPAGE PANEL USAGE:
---------------------
Using the Homepage Panel:

1.	Go to **Striking MultiFlex** -> **Homepage** in your backend.
2.	The **Home Page** setting will be set to None which means it is not a static page in use.
3.	The **Layout** setting determines the Homepage layout: left sidebar, right sidebar or full width.
4.	The **Homepage Slideshow** tab contains settings for the feature header area slideshow or disabling it.
5.	Write the html code you want to show to the text field of **Homepage Content Editor** tab.
6.	Click the Save changes button.   Go to website front which will reflect the input content.

![Homepage Panel][2]

The Homepage Panel is intended to provide a quick way for a beginning wp user to generate some front page content and it can act as a 1 page website while constructing the balance of pages for later release.  

#### SET A STATIC PAGE AS HOMEPAGE ####
The Homepage Panel lacks the advanced settings that come with the other page templates (such as the Page General Options Metabox, custom fields, etc)  nor will it be detected by an SEO plugin.  So if wanting this additional functionality for the website home either immediately or at a later date in design, then a static homepage should be created:

1.	Go to **Pages** -> **Add New** in the dashboard to create a new page.
2.	Give the page a title and input some content, then save it.
3.	Go to Striking MultiFlex  -> Homepage in the dashboard.
4.	In the **Homepage General** tab, use the **Home Page** setting to select the page just created (and which you likely named “Home”).
5.	 Click the Save changes button.  Now the front page of the website will reflect content input into the static homepage

STANDARD PAGE TEMPLATES
-----------------------
The left sidebar, right sidebar and full width templates are self-explanatory.   Please note that the full page width (including Homepage panel template) is 980 px, less 10px padding on each side – so the net content width is 960px.   If using a page w/sidebar, the main content area is 630 px wide and the sidebar area is 300px wide, and there is again padding so that the sidebar and page content have some spacing between them.  The net sidebar width for actual content is 275px. 
 
If interested in customizing the margins than one should review the Striking MultiFlex **screen.css** file found in striking_r/css/screen.css, commencing around line 1370 for the details of padding, margins and position.  

![Custom Screen Css][3]

Knowledge of Firebug or the Web Developer tools in a browser are invaluable for customizing of this nature.  Support for this advanced customization by the Striking support team is only available on a paid basis since it is code alterations to the theme templating.

### SETTING A DEFAULT PAGE SITE TEMPLATE ###
Please go to **General Panel** -> **General Page Layout Settings** and locate the **Set a Default Page Layout** setting, which has a dropdown field which enables a “preset” for the default page template automatically generated when creating any new page in the website.  

![Set Site Default Layout][4]

This is simply a convenience setting, so that it is not necessary to select a page template in the **Template** setting (see **Page Attributes** picture at the top of this section) each time a page is created.    One simply overrides the Default Template by choosing another page in the Template setting, when necessary.


SPECIAL PAGE TEMPLATES
----------------------
Striking MultiFlex has 3 special custom templates and following is an explanation of each:  

**Page with comments**:

 This page template includes the standard Wordpress comments module  at the bottom of the page.  It is not common to have pages with comments and support has to be added to a theme for comments to be enabled in a page.  Striking MultiFlex has chosen to do this via a separate page template.  

This layout of page will follow the **Default Page** template, but it can be changed to one of the other standard page templates using the **Layout** setting in the Page General Options Metabox.

In all other respects, the Page with Comments page template is 100% customizable by way of the Page General Options metabox settings for its feature header, colors, custom sidebars, etc.  

![][]  
  

**Sitemap**:  
     
The sitemap template is generally only employed once in a site, and it lists all the site pages with full hierarchy, Blog Posts, Blog Post Category Archives, and Portfolios.

Like any other page, it follows the Default Template but can be adjusted via the **Layout** setting and in all other respects, this page is 100% customizable by way of the Page General Options metabox settings for its feature header, colors, custom sidebars, etc.

It is not uncommon for the Sitemap page to be assigned a custom sidebar, and see the Custom Sidebar Section below for more information on Striking MultiFlex’s very advanced custom sidebar abilities.   


**Landing Page**:   

An exciting feature in Striking MultiFlex is the inclusion of a landing page template.

The landing page template differs from the normal template in that it has no navigation menu, no breadcrumbs, no footer, no shadows or gradients.  It still contains a logo, and a sub footer.  A button or image with linking is usually used for entry to the regular site.

Like any other page, it follows the Default Template but can be adjusted via the **Layout** setting and in all other respects, this page is 100% customizable by way of the Page General Options metabox settings for its feature header, colors, custom sidebars, etc.

With the Landing Page, it’s common for the feature header to be disabled and the page template to be full width, both accomplished via settings in the Page General Options metabox.  And then its content is set up as desired like any other page in the website.  

  
BOX MODE
--------
Striking MultiFlex also offers a Box Mode layout option.  This setting is found in the General Panel – General Page Layout settings.  In Box Mode, the site width is 1000px. 

![Boxed Layout Setting][5]

Striking MultiFlex offers a special background setting, and background color setting for when in the Box Mode.  The background or the background color will apply to the area outside of the 1000px frame.

![Boxed Layout Background][6]

So one can still load backgrounds for the feature header or footer, or set colors to these other content divisions in the page, and they will take effect.  Experiment and have some fun!!
